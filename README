The aim of this project is to parse discontinuous constituents with
Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP). Concretely, we build a DOP model with a Simple
Range Concatenation grammar as the symbolic backbone.

Requirements: 

	- python 2.6    http://www.python.org
	- NLTK          http://www.nltk.org
	- cpq           https://github.com/andreasvc/heapdict/tree/cheapdict
	- cython        (optional) http://www.cython.org
		needs cpq.pxd (see above)
		and array.pxd http://trac.cython.org/cython_trac/ticket/314
		compile with: "make"

plcfrs.py, rcgrules.py, kbest.py and runexp.py can be run without arguments as
a demonstration.
