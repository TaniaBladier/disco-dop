The aim of this project is to parse discontinuous constituents with
Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP). Concretely, we build a DOP model with a Simple
Range Concatenation grammar as the symbolic backbone.

Requirements: 

	- python 2.6    http://www.python.org
	- NLTK          http://www.nltk.org
	- cython        (optional) http://www.cython.org
		requires array support http://trac.cython.org/cython_trac/ticket/314
		compile with: "make". NB: compilation uses CFLAGS use to compile
		Python itself.

plcfrs.py, rcgrules.py, kbest.py and runexp.py can be run without arguments as
a demonstration.
