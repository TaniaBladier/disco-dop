The aim of this project is to parse discontinuous constituents with
Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP). Concretely, we build a DOP model with a Simple
Range Concatenation grammar as the symbolic backbone.

Requirements: 

	- python 2.6	http://www.python.org
	- NLTK 		http://www.nltk.org
	- heapdict 	https://github.com/dangra/heapdict/tarball/cheapdict
	- cython (optional). compile with:
		python setup.py build_ext --inplace

plcfrs.py, rcgrules.py and test.py can be run without arguments as a demonstration.
